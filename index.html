        A pretty baby with sparkling blue eyes was born and completed our family. You were always ready to laugh at your big sister and loved eating and sleeping! Achoo meatball was a favorite! You wanted us to read you ALL  the books! Your stuffed animals, Bob and woobie were necessary during book time. You loved going places and swinging on the swings. You tried every sport and club. As you grew up you brought home good grades and stories. Anything you set your mind to you achieved. We have loved watching you grow into the curious intelligent woman you are. Cheers to your first 30 years. We love you so much, Mom and Dad
