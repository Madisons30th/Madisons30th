(From Jordan) 30 years of having the privilege of learning from you and watching you navigate each curve and fork in the road and roadblock in life with grace and love and openness and resilience. I hit the jackpot in the sister department and our boys really hit it as far as aunts go. We are lucky you’re ours and we can’t wait to see all the good you continue to do. We love you so much 
        
        Clue: In days of yore, she'd swing and explore, deep conversations galore, with herself and much more. Not the same seat, but a similar donk, watch for geese and their angry honks
